<h3>
	Opening Remarks</h3>
<h4>
	<strong>Don Levy</strong></h4>
<p>Vice President for Research and National Laboratories</p>
<p><img alt="020_018-RCC-byJasonSmith-3926_0.JPG" src="Speakers_and_Abstracts/020_018-RCC-byJasonSmith-3926_0.JPG"></p>
<p><strong>Biography:</strong><br>
	Donald H. Levy, Albert A. Michelson Distinguished Service Professor in
Chemistry, is the University of Chicago’s Vice President for Research
and for National Laboratories, CEO of UChicago Argonne, LLC,
Vice-chairman of the Board of Governors for Argonne, and a Member of the
 Board of Directors for Fermilab.<br><br>
	Named to the University position in 2007, Levy’s responsibilities
include oversight of the management contracts for both Argonne National
Laboratory and Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, the Office of
Technology and Intellectual Policy, the Office of University Research
Administration, the Research Computing Center, Arete (UChicago’s
research accelerator), University-Argonne research centers and all
issues related to Human Subjects Research. The annual research budget of
 the University is more than $400 million. The combined annual research
budget for Argonne and Fermilab is $900 million.<br><br>
	In addition to his responsibilities for research across the University
and Argonne campuses, Levy chairs the Science Policy Council, a
collaboration with Argonne, Northwestern University and the University
of Illinois, established in 2005 to enhance Argonne's scientific
capabilities, to strengthen the state's technological base and workforce
 preparation, and to improve Illinois' ability to compete for federal
research funding.<br><br>
	Levy joined the University of Chicago faculty in 1967. He is a member
of the National Academy of Sciences and a Fellow of the American Academy
 of Arts and Sciences, the American Physical Society and the American
Association for the Advancement of Science. He is a former Chairman of
the Chemistry Department and he played an important leadership role in
planning the new Gordon Center for Integrative Science. A physical
chemist, Levy was a leader in developing and using supersonic jet
cooling to study the structure of molecules.<br><br>
	Levy was editor of the Journal of Chemical Physics from 1998 - 2008.
His awards include the E. Bright Wilson Award in Spectroscopy and the
Ellis Lippincott Award from the Optical Society of America and the
Plyler Prize of the American Physical Society. He received his B.A. from
 Harvard University, and his Ph.D. from the University of California,
Berkeley.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>
	Faculty Lightning Talks</h3>
<h4>
	<strong>Juan de Pablo</strong></h4>
<p>Liew Family Professor in Molecular Engineering, Institute for Molecular Engineering</p>
<p><strong><img alt="de_pablo.jpg" src="Speakers_and_Abstracts/de_pablo.jpg"></strong></p>
<p><strong>Biography/Research Interests</strong>:<br>
	Much of Juan de Pablo’s work entails conducting supercomputer
simulations to understand and design new materials from scratch and to
find applications for them.<br><br>
	He is a leader of simulations of polymeric materials, including DNA
dynamics — how DNA molecules arrange and organize themselves and
interact with other DNA molecules. He also studies protein aggregation
and its poorly understood relationship to various diseases, including
type II diabetes and neurodegenerative disorders.<br><br>
	De Pablo earned a bachelor’s degree in chemical engineering from
Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México in 1985. After completing his
doctorate in chemical engineering from the University of California,
Berkeley, in 1990, he conducted postdoctoral research at the Swiss
Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, Switzerland, then joined the
faculty of the University of Wisconsin. He came to the University of
Chicago in 2012.</p>
<h4>
	<strong>Andrey Kravtsov</strong></h4>
<p>Professor, Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Kavli Institute for Cosmological Physics, and The Enrico Fermi Institute</p>
<p><strong><img alt="kravtsov_0.jpg" src="Speakers_and_Abstracts/kravtsov_0.jpg"></strong></p>
<p><strong>Biography/Research Interests</strong>:<br>
	Andrey Kravtsov's main area of research is modeling of various aspects
of structure formation in the Universe using numerical simulations. The
primary focus of his work is thus development and analyses of computer
models of galaxies and galaxy clusters and tests of model predictions
against observations from very early epochs to the present. These tests
are used to investigate the implications of various hypotheses regarding
 the nature of dark matter and dark energy, as well as constraining
parameters of the cosmological model that describes our Universe. He is
also interested in developing and using new numerical and scientific
visualization techniques. To run high-resolution numerical
simulations&nbsp;he uses&nbsp;large supercomputers at the national
supercomputer centers and those abroad.<br><br>
	Kravtsov earned his bachelor's degree in physics and astronomy from
Moscow State University in 1994 and a master's degree in physics from
the same university in 1995. He earned a master's degree in astronomy in
 1997 and a PhD in astronomy and computer science in 1999 from New
Mexico State University.</p>
<h4>
	<strong>Burhaneddin Sandikci</strong></h4>
<p>Associate Professor of Operations Management, Booth School of Business</p>
<p><img alt="sandikci.JPG" src="Speakers_and_Abstracts/sandikci.JPG"></p>
<p><strong>Biography/Research Interests</strong>:<br>
	Burhaneddin Sandikçi studies decision-making problems under uncertainty
 with special interest in problems in medical decision making and health
 care operations. He is particularly interested in the mathematical
modeling and analysis of such problems. His research is widely motivated
 by practical considerations and he heavily uses real data in
calibrating and solving his models. His most recent work include
modeling and analyzing the accept/reject problem faced by liver
transplant patients. Using large databases and sophisticated
mathematical models, this work demonstrates the impact of using the
partially observable waiting list information (as available in the
current practice) on patient’s life expectancies.<br><br>
	A native of Turkey, Sandikçi earned a bachelor's degree in industrial
engineering from Marmara University in Istanbul in 1999. He earned two
master's degrees: one in industrial engineering from Bilkent University
in Ankara in 2001 and one in operations research from the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2003. He earned a PhD in industrial
engineering from the University of Pittsburgh in 2008. Sandikçi joined
the Chicago Booth faculty in 2008.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>
	<strong>John Goldsmith</strong></h4>
<p>Edward Carson Waller Distinguished Service Professor, Department of Linguistics, Department of Computer Science</p>
<p><img alt="goldsmith2_0.jpg" src="Speakers_and_Abstracts/goldsmith2_0.jpg"></p>
<p>Dr. John Goldsmith's current research interests lie in the history of
 linguistic thought, and the development of machine learning models for
the inference of linguistic structure from raw textual data. He spent
the academic year 2006-2007 working with Bernard Laks at the Université
de Paris X (Nanterre), working on a book entitled Battle in the Mind
Fields, dealing with the development of the mind sciences in the 20th
century.<br><br>
	Since 1997, he has been working on an open-source computational
linguistics project named&nbsp;Linguistica, whose goal is to
automatically develop a morphological analysis of an unknown language
from a raw sample of text, using the tools of information theory to make
 explicit what linguistic structure is.</p>
<h4>
	<strong>David Biron</strong></h4>
<p>Assistant Professor, Department of Physics, James Franck Institute, and the College</p>
<p><img alt="biron_0.jpg" src="Speakers_and_Abstracts/biron_0.jpg"></p>
<p><strong>Biography/Research Interests</strong>:<br><br>
	David Biron studies the behavior of the roundworm <em>Caenorhabditis elegans </em>in
 the hopes of shedding light on the function and evolutionary origins of
 animal behaviors such as locomotion, feeding and sleep. He is
particularly interested in the sleep-like behavior of <em>C. elegans</em>,
 and its implications for the origin of sleep in animals. To answer
these fundamental questions about animal behavior, Biron’s lab brings
together scientists from fields as disparate as physics, neuroscience
and genetics. Biron received his PhD from the Weizmann Institute in
2004, and joined the Chicago faculty in 2009.</p>
