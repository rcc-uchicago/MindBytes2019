"<em>Managing urban areas has become one of the most important development challenges of the 21st century. Our success or failure in building sustainable cities will be a major factor in the success of the post-2015 UN development agenda</em>",
                                    says John Wilmoth, Director of UN DESA’s Population Division. Exponential growth in urban density and cities brings numerous challenges and opportunities, both in the short and long term. Various types of data are being
                                    collected and analyzed today that may provide answers to the big questions faced by cities in the 21st century. One of the goals of this panel discussion is to educate attendees about current and future urban challenges,
                                    and how big data and technology is being used and can be used in the future to overcome them. This panel is comprised of distinguished faculty and people from outside the University with different areas of expertise.</h6>

                                            is distinguished by a passionate appreciation for each project’s unique challenges and the need for a comprehensive and innovative response.</p>
                                        <p class="text-justify">Voigt balances conceptual thinking with a realistic, hands-on approach. As a designer and planner, he works closely with city leaders, institutions, and developers across the globe. Although each project has its
                                            own story, a common focus on building long-term partnerships with clients and understanding their aspirations motivates his approach to design. Over the last two decades, he has been able to unite disparate
                                            stakeholders under a cohesive vision, transforming abstract ideas into physical realities.</p>

                                            allows for the positioning of new ideas that holistically address the possibilities of the site, program, energy, water, waste, transportation, and air quality within the parameters of economic realities and
