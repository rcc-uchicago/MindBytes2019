Her research investigates the coevolution of hosts and pathogens, especially the ways in which immune-mediated competition drives pathogen evolution, and the ways in which infection and vaccination shape the specificity of the host response. She received the NIH New Innovator Award and the Complex Systems Scholar Award from the James S. McDonnell Foundation to support her work on the coevolution of adaptive immune system and influenza. Before Chicago, Sarah spent three years as a NIH Ruth Kirschstein Fellow in the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics at the Harvard School of Public Health. Sarah received her PhD from the Ecology &amp; Evolutionary Biology Department at the University of Michigan in 2009.</p>

His work combines physical simulation, image analysis, statistics, and machine learning to understand complex biological dynamics, with present focuses on circadian rhythms, cytoskeletal dynamics, and algorithms for observing and interpreting rare events far from equilibrium.   He obtained his undergraduate (AB in Biochemical Sciences, 1994) and graduate (PhD in Biophysics, 1999) degrees at Harvard University, where he worked with Martin Karplus on Monte Carlo methods and their application to protein folding. Subsequently, he pursued postdoctoral studies at the University of Oxford (1999-2001), where he used hybrid quantum-mechanical/molecular-mechanical (QM/MM) methods to elucidate mechanisms of DNA repair, and the University of California, Berkeley (2001-2003), where he worked with David Chandler on transition path sampling and Arup Chakraborty on models of T lymphocyte signaling.  He joined the faculty at the University of Chicago in 2003.</p>

Prior to his graduate studies, he obtained a BS in mathematics from the University of Science and Technology of China.</p>
                                        <p class="text-justify">Dacheng Xiu’s research interests include developing statistical methodologies and applying them to financial data, while exploring their economic implications. His earlier research involved risk measurement and portfolio management with high-frequency data and econometric modeling of derivatives. His current work focuses on developing machine learning solutions to big-data problems in empirical asset pricing.</p>
                                        <p class="text-justify">Xiu’s work has appeared in Econometrica, the Journal of Econometrics, the Journal of the American Statistical Association, and the Annals of Statistics. Additionally, he was invited to publish in the Journal of Business and Economic Statistics. He is an Associate Editor for the Journal of Econometrics and Statistica Sinica, and also referees for several journals in the fields of econometrics, statistics, and finance. He has received several recognitions for his research, including the Dennis J. Aigner 2017 Honorable Mention for the best paper in empirical econometrics published by the Journal of Econometrics in 2015 or 2016, and the Best Conference Paper Prize at the 2017 Annual Meeting of the European Finance Association. In 2017, Xiu launched a website that provides up-to-date realized volatilities of individual stocks. These daily volatilities are calculated from the stocks’ intraday transactions and the methodologies are based on his research of high-frequency data.</p>
