Therefore, generation and justification of large capital funds far in advance of highly uncertain future returns often becomes difficult, resulting in (a) systematic underinvestment in infrastructure in many regions and (b) deprivation of these regions of investments in other economic areas due to fragile utility infrastructure. Analytical tools may be helpful to turn the future uncertainty in the returns of capital investments in the utility industry into a calculated risk.

Steady-state models of such disks require the inclusion of magnetic diffusivity. To make progress using ideal MHD, we focus on simplified \r\nfield configurations, involving purely vertical (B,) and azimuthal (B.) field components and a combination of the two. Additionally, we study the case of a wind-driving disk, in \r\nwhich a magnetic torque - B, dB.\'dz (where B, and B• are the equilibrium vertical and azimuthal field components) induces vertical angular momentum transport. For each of the models we calculate the locations of the relevant resonances and of the turning points, which delineate the propagation regions of the MHD waves that transport angular \r\nmomentum from the planet to the disk. We use both numerical and semianalytic methods to evaluate the cumulative back torque acting on the planet. We conclude that, under realistic (3D) circumstances, a large-scale magnetic field can slow down the inward migration that characterizes the underlying unmagnetized disk - by up to a factor \r\nof - 2 when the magnetic pressure approaches the thermal pressure - but it cannot reverse it. A previous inference that a pure-B• field whose amplitude decreases fast \r\nenough with radius leads to outward migration applies only in 2D. For a wind-driving disk configuration, we find the presence of a subdominant B • component whose amplitude increases from zero at z = 0 has little effect on the torque when acting alone, but in conjunction with a B, component it gives rise to a strong torque that speeds up \r\nthe inward migration of the planet.',NULL,1,0,NULL,'2014'),(3,'bhanpuri.pdf','','',NULL,'','',NULL,'','Identifying Students at Risk Accurately and Early','The high school dropout crisis in the United States claims more than one million students each year, costing individuals the loss of potential earnings and the nation hundreds of billions of dollars in lost revenue, lower economic activity and increased social services.

In the Global View Resilience (GVR) project, in order to mitigate or tolerate high error rate in the future, we have been developing a library which enables scientific applications to run reliably on unreliable computers. The GVR approach builds on a global view data model, adding versioning (multi-version), user control of timing and rate (multi-stream), and flexible cross layer error signalling and recovery. With a versioned array as a portable abstraction, GVR enables application programmers to exploit deep scientific and application code insights to manage resilience (and its overhead) in a flexible, portable fashion.

Molecular simulations are one tool to resolve the structures of proteins on the angstrom and picosecond scales that can be applied to a diverse set of systems. This poster discusses how advanced sampling techniques such as bias exchange metadynamics and replica exchange solute tempering were used to determine the important conformations of proteins in a variety of environments. For example, the aggregation of the peptide human amylin has been associated with the formation of type II diabetes. Oligomers of amylin are suspected to cause the death of insulin producing cells in the pancreas; however, their transient nature has made them difficult to identify experimentally. Molecular simulations were used to probe the conformations of single peptides in solution. The fraction of peptides in a β-hairpin, α-helix, or random coil state was determined for human and rat amylin. Different force fields and their resulting ensembles of structures were then evaluated on their ability to reproduce experimentally measured NMR chemical shifts. Another project presented is the role of the chirality of peptides in forming coacervates, a liquid-liquid phase separation with applications in drug delivery, gene therapy, food sciences, and cosmetics. While homochiral peptides form precipitates, achiral systems instead form coacervates.

Continuum-based LC models have been successful for decades in predicting and understanding LC systems. Traditional numerical techniques, however, lack fluctuations, and sufficiently complex LC systems can be challenging to model with these approaches. We propose a Monte-Carlo based continuum approach to avoid this limitation. By looking at a variety of LC systems, we demonstrate that our proposed approach is an effective means of avoiding local energy minima. Recent experiments have demonstrated that when micrometer-sized particles are placed at the surface of an LC droplet, these particles tend to form hexagonal 2D crystals. To understand this phenomenon, we use a continuum-based LC model to measure the free-energy of various particle arrangements. With a combination of theory, simulation and experiment, we now have a more complete understanding of these particle-decorated droplets. For some LC phenomena, a continuum model is insufficient. Recent experiments looking at the interaction between complex lipids and LCs necessarily require a model with greater molecular detail. To simulate these systems, we use an atomistic approach.

Consequently, simulations hardly capture the transition from laminar flow to turbulence and turbulent cascade on small scales is not resolved. The unresolved turbulent motions exert pressure which is not taken into account in modern cosmological simulations. To model this additional pressure support we need a Sub-Grid Scale (SGS) model of turbulence. Following the method described by [Schmidt et al 2014] such model was implemented in cosmological code ART. Fully turbulent box tests performed with ART show that the model works fairly well for developed isotropic turbulence.

The method, however, is limited by the requirement of individual-level genotype and phenotype data, which are not widely available for large GWAS. In contrast, single-SNP association summary statistics are often released in public domain. Here we present a new Bayesian method for multiple-SNP pathway analysis that relies solely on GWAS summary statistics and linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure inferred from a public reference panel. Our method adopts a recently proposed large-scale Bayesian regression model for GWAS summary statistics (Zhu and Stephens, ASHG 2015). Unlike in previous work where each SNP was treated equally likely to be associated with the phenotype a priori, the new method allows the prior probability of each SNP being associated to depend on its membership of a pathway so that potential enrichment of associations within the pathway can be captured.

Common numerical models, in which star formation efficiency (SFE) is assumed constant (at the level of few %) above certain density threshold, by their design are not suitable for this purpose. Theoretically, variation of SFE is attributed to the turbulent nature of interstellar medium. Unfortunately, state-of-art galaxy formation models lack relevant small-scale motions due to limited resolution that hardly reaches typical scale of the largest GMCs (few 10 pc). However, with an appropriate subgrid model of turbulence star formation can be connected to resolved dynamics with the aid of theoretical and numerical models of star formation in turbulent medium. In this work we implement such model coupled with prescription for star formation in compressible MHD turbulence. We find that our model predicts distribution of r.m.s. turbulent velocities consistent with local and extragalactic observations (on average few km/s on 100 pc scale). In our model turbulence is produced in warm gas (T ∼ 104 K) at level of few km/s and is amplified by compression in spiral arms up to few tens km/s. As far as star formation is concerned, in our simulation we observe distribution of rates that is in a good agreement with both local GMCs data and resolved extragalactic star formation maps.

Herein, we provide a complete atomic level description of the key steps of the proton pumping mechanism in aa3-type CcO. We have used multiscale reactive molecular dynamics simulations to explicitly characterize (with free energy profiles and calculated rates) the internal proton transport events that enable pumping and chemistry during a reaction step that involves proton transport to the pump loading site (PLS) and to the catalytic site (binuclear center, BNC) (the A→PR→F transition). Our results show that both proton transport events are thermodynamically driven by electron transfer from heme a to the BNC, but that pumping (amino acid residue E286 to the PLS) is kinetically favored, while transfer of the chemical proton (E286 to the BNC) is rate-limiting. The calculated rates are in quantitative agreement with experimental measurement. The back flow of the pumped proton from the PLS to E286 is prevented by the fast reprotonation of E286 through the D-channel and a large free energy barrier for the back flow reaction. Proton transport through the D-channel is not rate-limiting during the A→PR→F transition, but is strongly coupled to solvation changes across the N121-N139 asparagine gate. Our results also show how the D-channel biases unidirectional proton transport from the inner to outer side of the membrane.',NULL,1,0,NULL,'2015'),(40,'poster_draft_1v2.pdf','','',NULL,'','',NULL,'','Predicting Chicago Real Estate Market Absorption','Opportunities to support urban economic decision-making with analytical models are extensive in the real estate market. Both buyers and sellers face uncertainty in real estate transactions in large metropolitan areas about when to time a transaction and at what cost. A housing demand index based on microscopic home showings events data can provide decision-making support for buyers and sellers on a very granular time and spatial scale. In the current real estate market, both buyers and sellers make decisions without knowing the present and future state of the large and dynamic real estate market. Consequently, accurate and granular housing market demand forecasts play a valuable role in these decisions. In this paper, we aim to predict housing market demand by developing housing demand indices using high-volume, high-velocity data on home showings, listing events, and historic sales data. By employing a combination of traditional market measures supplemented by the number of home showings, the indices result in timely insight into housing market demand. We demonstrate our analysis using data from seven million individual records sourced from a unique, proprietary dataset that has not previously been explored in application to the real estate market.

Vaccination either drives the viral population extinct, or the population persists and evolves further than if vaccination had not taken place at all. Increasing vaccination rate decreases pathogen survival, but increases the antigenic evolution of surviving populations and the incidence among hosts.

To capture selective advantage of loss- and gain-of-function mutations, we learned parameters in our model by fitting with data from known tumor suppressors or oncogenes respectively. The cancer baseline model was trained based on genes without proven roles in cancer. We next tried to classify genes or variants based on a Bayesian model selection method. Our method greatly increases power and reduces false positive rate compared to current mainstream methods.

To reduce losses, the USDA Forest Service developed Tussock moth biocontrol-1 (TMB-1), by using a naturally occurring nucleopolyhedrovirus (NPV) as a sprayed pesticide, but sometimes unsprayed controls have the same infection rates as sprayed plots.  We used field experiments, mathematical modeling, and high performance computing to show that the lack of difference between sprayed and control plots occurs because repeated rounds of transmission in control plots can allow initially low infection rates to build up to levels that match the sprayed plots, rather than because sprayed virus is less infectious than naturally occurring virus.  Our work suggests that the virus should be sprayed when insect densities are still low, implying in turn that spray decisions should be based on precise estimates of larval abundances and natural NPV infection.','Scalability and Performance, Big Data',1,0,'','2017'),(74,'04212017174315_posterMOORING042117.pdf','Todd Mooring','tmooring@uchicago.edu','Postdoctoral Scholar','Physical Sciences Division','Geophysical Sciences','Cluster Partnership Program, Software Packages','Prof. Tiffany Shaw','Understanding Midlatitude Climate Change in a Hierarchy of Models','Much of the current work in the Shaw group focuses on climate change in the extratropics, the region poleward of ~30 degrees latitude.

IDE also degrades amyloid-β, a peptide vital for Alzheimer\'s disease progression. IDE has two homologous, ~50 kDa N- and C-terminal domains, IDE-N and IDE-C. For IDE to effectively degrade its substrates, both domains must come together for the catalytic cleft to assume fully closed conformation. Experimental data suggests that IDE undergoes at least two conformational switches in its catalytic cycle: one, the transition between the closed- and open-conformations, and two, the “swinging door” motion at the catalytic cleft. However, the exact mechanism of these two conformational switches is unknown. We investigated this mechanism using microsecond-long molecular dynamics simulations of IDE structures with and without substrate. We find that the N-terminus of the insulin molecule chain-A forms a cross-β-sheet with IDE secondary structure elements, placing insulin near the catalytic site. Concordantly, insulin also undergoes conformational change; the insulin chain-B central α-helix becomes less ordered, a key step in the unfolding of insulin for degradation. The presence of insulin moves IDE-N and IDE-C closer (the angle between them decreases ~5°) and causes these two domains to undergo a grinding motion. Furthermore, greater flexibility for the door, H-loop, and the hinge and interface between IDE-N and IDE-C is evident when insulin is present. These observations suggest that the presence of insulin induces both global and local conformational changes in IDE to unfold insulin for cleavage. Principal component analysis shows negatively- correlated opening and closing motions of dimeric IDE, suggesting that the capture of substrate in one monomer may allosterically induce the other to open. Our simulation and principle component analysis offer new insight into substrate unfolding inside the IDE catalytic chamber and its allosteric regulation.','Scalability and Performance',1,0,'','2017'),(84,'04242017143402_Amyloid-Lipid-MindByts-2017.pdf','Esmael Jafari Haddadian','haddadian@uchicago.edu','Assistant Professor','Biological Sciences Division','Biology','Midway','Esmael Jafari Haddadian','Membrane Bilayers Help to Stabilize and Are Affected by Aβ-Peptides on the Surface','Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is an important and increasingly prevalent neurodegenerative disease. Aggregation of Aβ-peptides is important in etiology of AD and the interaction of these peptides with cell membranes is probably one of the key pathological events responsible for neuron cell death in AD. Using the supercomputer Anton, we modeled the interaction of unstructured Aβ-monomers and Aβ-peptides in the fibril structure (residues 1-40, PDB ID 2M4J, based on an AD brain-seeded fibril structure) with different lipid bilayers (POPC/Cholesterol, ratio 4:1; POPC/POPG/Cholesterol, 1:1:1; POPC/POPE/POPG 1:1:1). Our 20 -second long simulations starting with unstructured Aβ-monomers close to the lipid surface showed that the bilayer greatly accelerated the rate of structural conversion from a random coil to a β-structure as well as the aggregation of Aβ from monomers to interacting oligomers in comparison to our bulk simulations. This was the case regardless of the lipid composition. The six-layer brain-seeded fibril on the lipid surface partially unraveled, mainly, at its end facing away from the lipid; however, it maintained its overall shape and matched the structural stability of an infinitely long fibril model that we previously simulated. The brain-seeded fibril structure interacted strongly with lipid head-group atoms and constrained the motion of the lipid molecules under the structure; the diffusion of these molecules was reduced. These interactions also increased the ordering of lipid molecules underneath the fibril. Our simulations suggest that Aβ fibrils change the fluidity of the lipid bilayers and therefore may affect cellular function.','Scalability and Performance',1,0,'','2017'),(85,'04242017215206_posterSevgen042417.pdf','Selami Emre Sevgen','sesevgen@uchicago.edu','Graduate Student','Institute for Molecular Engineering','Institute for Molecular Engineering','Computational Scientists, Midway, Software Packages','Juan de Pablo','SSAGES (Software Suite for Advanced Generalized Ensemble Simulations) - Development and Applications','Molecular simulations are an essential tool in modern research, guiding experimental efforts and providing fundamental insights into underlying phenomena.

We show that given a list of job with predetermined PUR and estimated runtime, our algorithm schedules high PUR jobs to run when electricity is relatively low, thus reducing the total cost.','',1,0,'','2017'),(101,'04262017121138_poster_Tharsen_04262017.pdf','Jeffrey Tharsen','tharsen@uchicago.edu','Computational Scientist','Other University organization/affiliation','RCC','Computational Scientists, Consultant Partnership Program, Visualization','Victoria Saramago','The Visual Text Explorer','The Visual Text Explorer grew out of a research goal presented to the RCC by Prof. Victoria Saramago of the University of Chicago’s Romance Languages department: she wanted a means by which she could visually display the interactions between named characters in the Portuguese novel Grande Sertão, but rather than the standard approach, which would be to visualize the names and their relative proximity within the text in a social network diagram, she requested that the visualization incorporate the original text as well, so that the precise nature of the characters’ interactions could be explicitly interrogated.

To investigate the differences between wild-type and mutant Aβ-peptides, we modeled their behavior at three levels: monomer, finite and infinite fibrils; using molecular dynamics. The Osaka mutant demonstrated the most structural stability among the fibrils, and we present two possible structural features that might be responsible for this. Furthermore, we compare the pre-aggregation point to the end-point of aggregation and show that the pre-aggregates of the mutants are structurally closer to the corresponding fibrils and that they are likely more energetically favorable than the wild-type.','Computing',1,0,NULL,'2018'),(106,'04102018124547_PosterMork041018.pdf','Ryan Lee Mork','mork@uchicago.edu','graduate student','Biological Sciences Division','Biophysics','','Andrey Rzhetsky','Staphylococcus aureus colonization, infection is heritable in humans','Surprisingly little is known about how the host\'s genetics and environmental encounters influence the long-term composition of the microbiome.

We use the combination of network analyses of genetic similarity with agent-based models that track immune memory in each host, to identify signatures of dominant processes underlying strain structure.

However, maintaining the data warehouse can take a titanic amount of memory space and time. Thus, I built an optimized and automated spatial data warehouse stored in the Research Computing Center server for managing data more efficiently. As an example, I use the NETS data that contains approximately 60 million businesses across the US from 1990 to 2014. The main objective is to illustrate the creation of a replicable and automated spatial data warehouse. In this undertaking, I show the memory capacity limits when importing the data (with tables approximately greater than 11 GB) and the optimization of the import process by using a parallel GNU solution (making it approximately 4 times faster).  Finally, I exemplify an automated query of small business grocery stores in Chicago, presenting a Kernel Density Estimation map of the establishmentsâ€™ concentration in the city.','Computing',1,0,NULL,'2018'),(134,'04232018142802_ASHG_2017_poster_DPR.pdf','Daniel P Rice','dpr@uchicago.edu','Postdoctoral scholar','Biological Sciences Division','Human Genetics','Midway, Cluster Partnership Program','John Novembre','Distinguishing among coalescent models using two-site joint allele frequency spectra','The genetic diversity of a population reflects its demographic and evolutionary history. Methods for inferring this history typically assume that the ancestry of a sample can be modeled by the Kingman coalescent process. However, this assumption breaks down under several scenarios. For example, pervasive natural selection, rapid geographic range expansion, and extreme variation in offspring number can all generate genealogies with \"multiple-merger\" events in which more than two lineages coalesce instantaneously. Therefore, detecting multiple mergers is important both for understanding which forces have shaped the diversity of a population and for avoiding fitting misspecified models to data. Here, weÂ present a new method for detecting multiple mergers based on correlations in the site frequency spectrum at nearby sites.','Data Science',1,0,NULL,'2018'),(135,'04232018163421_poster-mribrain.pdf','Elahi Siraj','sergioelahi@uchicago.edu','Staff','Other University organization/affiliation','RCC','','','JHP MRI Brain Atlas','This atlas was developed to identify the major neuroanatomical structures of the entire brain on MRI scan, in both interactive digital technology and in print.

We then used mixed-effects regression model by linking disease data with several other environmental databases at the U.S. county level. The computational investigation suggests that (a) the spatial prevalence of six mental conditions are remarkably different, (b) air and land pollution are important environmental predictors of the frequency of the clinical appearance of bipolar disorder and major depression, and (c) that psychiatric disorders should be an important component of efforts to quantify and understand effects of chronic pollutant exposures.','Visualization',1,0,NULL,'2018'),(137,'04242018101250_Mind_bites(Michael)_final.pdf','Michael Park','michaelpark@uchicago.edu','graduate student','SSA','SSA','Software Packages','Yoonsun Choi','Effect of neighborhood ethnic density/composition on Korean and Filipino youth’s depressive symptoms and academic performance: Testing the Heterogeneous Associations by Nativity, Ethnicity, and Gender','Title: Effect of neighborhood ethnic density/composition on Korean and Filipino youthâ€™s depressive symptoms and academic performance: Testing the Heterogeneous Associations by Nativity, Ethnicity, and Gender\n\nThis study aims to examine 1) the associations between the neighborhood ethnic density/composition and youth outcomes (i.e., depressive symptoms and academic outcomes) with Filipino and Korean American youth and 2) Whether these associations vary by nativity status (i.e., foreign-born vs. U.S.-born), ethnic background, and gender.','Data Science',1,0,NULL,'2018'),(138,'04242018150728_posterGuo042418.pdf','Ashley Guo','azguo@uchicago.edu','PhD student','Institute for Molecular Engineering','Molecular Engineering','Midway, Software Packages','Juan de Pablo','Human Islet Amyloid Polypeptide: Identifying Early-Stage Aggregation Mechanisms through Molecular Simulation','Human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) is implicated in the onset of type II diabetes and is known to aggregate into amyloid fibrils.
