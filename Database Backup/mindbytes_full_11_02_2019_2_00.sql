Steady-state models of such disks require the inclusion of magnetic diffusivity. To make progress using ideal MHD, we focus on simplified \r\nfield configurations, involving purely vertical (B,) and azimuthal (B.) field components and a combination of the two. Additionally, we study the case of a wind-driving disk, in \r\nwhich a magnetic torque - B, dB.\'dz (where B, and B• are the equilibrium vertical and azimuthal field components) induces vertical angular momentum transport. For each of the models we calculate the locations of the relevant resonances and of the turning points, which delineate the propagation regions of the MHD waves that transport angular \r\nmomentum from the planet to the disk. We use both numerical and semianalytic methods to evaluate the cumulative back torque acting on the planet. We conclude that, under realistic (3D) circumstances, a large-scale magnetic field can slow down the inward migration that characterizes the underlying unmagnetized disk - by up to a factor \r\nof - 2 when the magnetic pressure approaches the thermal pressure - but it cannot reverse it. A previous inference that a pure-B• field whose amplitude decreases fast \r\nenough with radius leads to outward migration applies only in 2D. For a wind-driving disk configuration, we find the presence of a subdominant B • component whose amplitude increases from zero at z = 0 has little effect on the torque when acting alone, but in conjunction with a B, component it gives rise to a strong torque that speeds up \r\nthe inward migration of the planet.',NULL,1,0,NULL,'2014'),(3,'bhanpuri.pdf','','',NULL,'','',NULL,'','Identifying Students at Risk Accurately and Early','The high school dropout crisis in the United States claims more than one million students each year, costing individuals the loss of potential earnings and the nation hundreds of billions of dollars in lost revenue, lower economic activity and increased social services.

In the Global View Resilience (GVR) project, in order to mitigate or tolerate high error rate in the future, we have been developing a library which enables scientific applications to run reliably on unreliable computers. The GVR approach builds on a global view data model, adding versioning (multi-version), user control of timing and rate (multi-stream), and flexible cross layer error signalling and recovery. With a versioned array as a portable abstraction, GVR enables application programmers to exploit deep scientific and application code insights to manage resilience (and its overhead) in a flexible, portable fashion.

Molecular simulations are one tool to resolve the structures of proteins on the angstrom and picosecond scales that can be applied to a diverse set of systems. This poster discusses how advanced sampling techniques such as bias exchange metadynamics and replica exchange solute tempering were used to determine the important conformations of proteins in a variety of environments. For example, the aggregation of the peptide human amylin has been associated with the formation of type II diabetes. Oligomers of amylin are suspected to cause the death of insulin producing cells in the pancreas; however, their transient nature has made them difficult to identify experimentally. Molecular simulations were used to probe the conformations of single peptides in solution. The fraction of peptides in a β-hairpin, α-helix, or random coil state was determined for human and rat amylin. Different force fields and their resulting ensembles of structures were then evaluated on their ability to reproduce experimentally measured NMR chemical shifts. Another project presented is the role of the chirality of peptides in forming coacervates, a liquid-liquid phase separation with applications in drug delivery, gene therapy, food sciences, and cosmetics. While homochiral peptides form precipitates, achiral systems instead form coacervates.

In fact, in cases in which the low and high levels of theory favor very different solutions, this approach could lead to local traps and slow down convergence.

Continuum-based LC models have been successful for decades in predicting and understanding LC systems. Traditional numerical techniques, however, lack fluctuations, and sufficiently complex LC systems can be challenging to model with these approaches. We propose a Monte-Carlo based continuum approach to avoid this limitation. By looking at a variety of LC systems, we demonstrate that our proposed approach is an effective means of avoiding local energy minima. Recent experiments have demonstrated that when micrometer-sized particles are placed at the surface of an LC droplet, these particles tend to form hexagonal 2D crystals. To understand this phenomenon, we use a continuum-based LC model to measure the free-energy of various particle arrangements. With a combination of theory, simulation and experiment, we now have a more complete understanding of these particle-decorated droplets. For some LC phenomena, a continuum model is insufficient. Recent experiments looking at the interaction between complex lipids and LCs necessarily require a model with greater molecular detail. To simulate these systems, we use an atomistic approach.

Consequently, simulations hardly capture the transition from laminar flow to turbulence and turbulent cascade on small scales is not resolved. The unresolved turbulent motions exert pressure which is not taken into account in modern cosmological simulations. To model this additional pressure support we need a Sub-Grid Scale (SGS) model of turbulence. Following the method described by [Schmidt et al 2014] such model was implemented in cosmological code ART. Fully turbulent box tests performed with ART show that the model works fairly well for developed isotropic turbulence. However, the model needs to be improved to reproduce dynamics of stratified turbulent flows which are the most important ones from the practical point of view.

The method, however, is limited by the requirement of individual-level genotype and phenotype data, which are not widely available for large GWAS. In contrast, single-SNP association summary statistics are often released in public domain. Here we present a new Bayesian method for multiple-SNP pathway analysis that relies solely on GWAS summary statistics and linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure inferred from a public reference panel. Our method adopts a recently proposed large-scale Bayesian regression model for GWAS summary statistics (Zhu and Stephens, ASHG 2015). Unlike in previous work where each SNP was treated equally likely to be associated with the phenotype a priori, the new method allows the prior probability of each SNP being associated to depend on its membership of a pathway so that potential enrichment of associations within the pathway can be captured.

However, with an appropriate subgrid model of turbulence star formation can be connected to resolved dynamics with the aid of theoretical and numerical models of star formation in turbulent medium. In this work we implement such model coupled with prescription for star formation in compressible MHD turbulence. We find that our model predicts distribution of r.m.s. turbulent velocities consistent with local and extragalactic observations (on average few km/s on 100 pc scale). In our model turbulence is produced in warm gas (T ∼ 104 K) at level of few km/s and is amplified by compression in spiral arms up to few tens km/s. As far as star formation is concerned, in our simulation we observe distribution of rates that is in a good agreement with both local GMCs data and resolved extragalactic star formation maps. The resulting variation of efficiency is found to be due to scatter in turbulent properties. Our model predicts high abundance of molecular gas inefficiently forming stars along with existence of very efficient GMCs.',NULL,1,0,NULL,'2015'),(34,'MindBytes 2015_v6.pdf','','',NULL,'','',NULL,'','In Silico Construction of a Host/Pathogen Patient Cohort Using HPC Parameter Sweeps on an Agent Based Model of Sepsis','Current predictive models for sepsis generally use correlative methods, and as such are limited in their individual precision due to patient heterogeneity and data sparseness.

We have used multiscale reactive molecular dynamics simulations to explicitly characterize (with free energy profiles and calculated rates) the internal proton transport events that enable pumping and chemistry during a reaction step that involves proton transport to the pump loading site (PLS) and to the catalytic site (binuclear center, BNC) (the A→PR→F transition). Our results show that both proton transport events are thermodynamically driven by electron transfer from heme a to the BNC, but that pumping (amino acid residue E286 to the PLS) is kinetically favored, while transfer of the chemical proton (E286 to the BNC) is rate-limiting. The calculated rates are in quantitative agreement with experimental measurement. The back flow of the pumped proton from the PLS to E286 is prevented by the fast reprotonation of E286 through the D-channel and a large free energy barrier for the back flow reaction. Proton transport through the D-channel is not rate-limiting during the A→PR→F transition, but is strongly coupled to solvation changes across the N121-N139 asparagine gate.

To understand the effects of vaccination on such a fast-evolving pathogen, we simulated the dynamics of influenza in a vaccinated host population. Increasing vaccination rate decreases the average cumulative antigenic evolution of the viral population. However, the distribution of outcomes is clearly bimodal. Vaccination either drives the viral population extinct, or the population persists and evolves further than if vaccination had not taken place at all. Increasing vaccination rate decreases pathogen survival, but increases the antigenic evolution of surviving populations and the incidence among hosts. These results illustrate how vaccination against a pathogen whose evolution is driven by positive selection for rapidly emerging strains can antagonize or enhance antigenic evolution to the respective detriment or benefit of hosts.','',0,0,'','2017'),(69,'04212017155807_MindBytes-Guo.pdf','Ashley Guo','azguo@uchicago.edu','Graduate student','Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering','Institute for Molecular Engineering','Midway, Software Packages','Juan de Pablo','Amyloidogenic Proteins: Identifying Early-stage Aggregation Mechanisms','Human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) is implicated in the onset of type II diabetes. hIAPP is known to aggregate into amyloid fibrils; however, it is prefibrillar species, not mature fibrils, that are proposed to be cytotoxic.

We used field experiments, mathematical modeling, and high performance computing to show that the lack of difference between sprayed and control plots occurs because repeated rounds of transmission in control plots can allow initially low infection rates to build up to levels that match the sprayed plots, rather than because sprayed virus is less infectious than naturally occurring virus.

IDE also degrades amyloid-β, a peptide vital for Alzheimer\'s disease progression. IDE has two homologous, ~50 kDa N- and C-terminal domains, IDE-N and IDE-C. For IDE to effectively degrade its substrates, both domains must come together for the catalytic cleft to assume fully closed conformation. Experimental data suggests that IDE undergoes at least two conformational switches in its catalytic cycle: one, the transition between the closed- and open-conformations, and two, the “swinging door” motion at the catalytic cleft. However, the exact mechanism of these two conformational switches is unknown. We investigated this mechanism using microsecond-long molecular dynamics simulations of IDE structures with and without substrate. We find that the N-terminus of the insulin molecule chain-A forms a cross-β-sheet with IDE secondary structure elements, placing insulin near the catalytic site. Concordantly, insulin also undergoes conformational change; the insulin chain-B central α-helix becomes less ordered, a key step in the unfolding of insulin for degradation. The presence of insulin moves IDE-N and IDE-C closer (the angle between them decreases ~5°) and causes these two domains to undergo a grinding motion. Furthermore, greater flexibility for the door, H-loop, and the hinge and interface between IDE-N and IDE-C is evident when insulin is present. These observations suggest that the presence of insulin induces both global and local conformational changes in IDE to unfold insulin for cleavage. Principal component analysis shows negatively- correlated opening and closing motions of dimeric IDE, suggesting that the capture of substrate in one monomer may allosterically induce the other to open. Our simulation and principle component analysis offer new insight into substrate unfolding inside the IDE catalytic chamber and its allosteric regulation.','Scalability and Performance',1,0,'','2017'),(84,'04242017143402_Amyloid-Lipid-MindByts-2017.pdf','Esmael Jafari Haddadian','haddadian@uchicago.edu','Assistant Professor','Biological Sciences Division','Biology','Midway','Esmael Jafari Haddadian','Membrane Bilayers Help to Stabilize and Are Affected by Aβ-Peptides on the Surface','Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is an important and increasingly prevalent neurodegenerative disease. Aggregation of Aβ-peptides is important in etiology of AD and the interaction of these peptides with cell membranes is probably one of the key pathological events responsible for neuron cell death in AD. Using the supercomputer Anton, we modeled the interaction of unstructured Aβ-monomers and Aβ-peptides in the fibril structure (residues 1-40, PDB ID 2M4J, based on an AD brain-seeded fibril structure) with different lipid bilayers (POPC/Cholesterol, ratio 4:1; POPC/POPG/Cholesterol, 1:1:1; POPC/POPE/POPG 1:1:1). Our 20 -second long simulations starting with unstructured Aβ-monomers close to the lipid surface showed that the bilayer greatly accelerated the rate of structural conversion from a random coil to a β-structure as well as the aggregation of Aβ from monomers to interacting oligomers in comparison to our bulk simulations. This was the case regardless of the lipid composition. The six-layer brain-seeded fibril on the lipid surface partially unraveled, mainly, at its end facing away from the lipid; however, it maintained its overall shape and matched the structural stability of an infinitely long fibril model that we previously simulated. The brain-seeded fibril structure interacted strongly with lipid head-group atoms and constrained the motion of the lipid molecules under the structure; the diffusion of these molecules was reduced. These interactions also increased the ordering of lipid molecules underneath the fibril. Our simulations suggest that Aβ fibrils change the fluidity of the lipid bilayers and therefore may affect cellular function.','Scalability and Performance',1,0,'','2017'),(85,'04242017215206_posterSevgen042417.pdf','Selami Emre Sevgen','sesevgen@uchicago.edu','Graduate Student','Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering','Institute for Molecular Engineering','Computational Scientists, Midway, Software Packages','Juan de Pablo','SSAGES (Software Suite for Advanced Generalized Ensemble Simulations) - Development and Applications','Molecular simulations are an essential tool in modern research, guiding experimental efforts and providing fundamental insights into underlying phenomena.

There\'s a long debate about whether ideology has any independent explanatory power in historical processes. We found that the party\'s official rhetoric has progressed in a very linear and smooth fashion. Newness always comes out of old repertoires, and controversial concepts like \"market economy\" only became stabilized by attaching to an existing stable rhetorical subspace.

It is also easy to mount and fine tune the model modules to other targets and achieve potential downstream tasks.

By applying single-cell RNA-sequencing to spontaneously differentiating stem cell organoids, or embryoid bodies, we aim to develop a renewable resource of potentially hundreds of human cell types, which can be used to explore relationships among genetic variants, gene regulation, human evolution, and complex human traits.',NULL,0,0,NULL,'2019'),(190,'10262019123951_posterCao102619.pdf','Guoshuai Cao','guoshuaicao@uchicago.edu','Graduate Student','Pritzker School of Molecular Engineering','Immuno-engineering','','Jun Huang','Lattice light-sheet microscopy Multi-Dimensional Analyses (LaMDA) of T-cell receptor dynamics predict T-cell signal','We report the development of lattice light-sheet microscopy multi-dimensional analyses (LaMDA), a pipeline that combines high spatiotemporal-resolution four-dimensional lattice light-sheet microscopy, machine learning, and diffusion maps to analyze T-cell receptor (TCR) dynamics and predict T-cell signaling states without the need for complex biochemical measurements. LaMDA images thousands of TCR microclusters on the surface of live primary cells to collect high-dimensional dynamic data for machine learning, which extracts key dynamic features to build predictive diffusion maps. LaMDA spatiotemporally accurately differentiates stimulated cells from unstimulated cells, precisely predicts attenuated T-cell signaling after CD4 and CD28 receptor blockades, and reliably discriminates between structurally similar TCR ligands.

SiC is a particularly attractive material because of its ease of growth and microfabrication compared to diamond. Divacancy defects in SiC have been shown to host optically active electronic spins with long coherence times even at room temperature, thus providing a basis for quantum technologies. However, the formation mechanism and migration properties of point defects in SiC are poorly understood and hence difficult to control. Using advanced simulation techniques, we gain insight into the creation, interaction and migration of vacancies in SiC, aimed at deriving rules for the design of robust defects in scalable quantum materials. In particular, we used a combination of enhanced sampling methods coupled with classical Molecular Dynamics to investigate mechanisms of the formation and migration of vacancy defects in 3C-SiC.',NULL,0,0,NULL,'2019'),(194,'10282019142252_posterSENFT102819.pdf','Stephen Senft','ssenft@mbl.edu','Research Associate','Marine Biological Laboratory','MRC, Bell Center','Computational Scientists, Midway, Consultant Partnership Program, Software Packages, Visualization','Roger Hanlon','Using 3D segmentation to characterize ultrastructural determinants of biophotonic reflectivity in cephalopod skin.','The optical features of cephalopod skin provide the basis for the sophisticated camouflage capabilities of these remarkable animals.

The results presented here set the stage for the future aim of deriving the oriented spectral reflective properties of ensembles of these nano-scale particles observed in this tissue.

Evaluating the precise mix of these effects based on computations using actual morphometry will help us to understand how this highly evolved tissue organization contributes to camouflage and communication for these animals.',NULL,0,0,NULL,'2019'),(195,'10282019145235_mind_bytes.pdf','L.C.

Our simulations of nucleosome arrays using enhanced sampling techniques have revealed two distinct, metastable structural states present in chromatin fibers, separated by a free energy difference on the order of 1 kbT per nucleosome. The relative stability of these states, and the energy penalty of transitioning between them, is revealed to be highly sensitive to the presence of a linker histone, the nucleosome repeat length, and the presence of histone acetylation on the nucleosome H4 tails.

As few as 20 neurons yielded robust decoding performance in all monkeys. We found that neuronal signals from rostral M1 yield better decoding performance than do their counterparts in caudal M1, and signals in area 3a yield better performance than do those in area 2. Hand postures (joint angles) are decoded significantly better than hand movements (joint angular velocities) from both M1 and SC, in contrast to what has been observed for arm kinematics during reaching, for which angular velocities are better decoded. Exploiting the assumption of automonous dynamics (LFADS) significantly improves decoding performance for reaching but not for grasping.',NULL,1,0,NULL,'2019'),(199,'10282019164929_SfN2019_Poster.pdf','Charles Greenspon','cmgreenspon@uchicago.edu','Postdoctoral Scholar','Biological Sciences Division','OBA','','','Dependence of Texture-Elicited Skin Vibrations on Scanning Speed','We are exquisitely sensitive to surface microstructure and to the material properties of objects. To sense the finest elements of a texture requires movement between the skin and a surface, which elicits vibrations in the skin that are dependent on both the texture and the way it is explored. Indeed, the vibrations dilate or contract with increases or decreases in scanning speed, respectively. While the effect of scanning speed on the frequency composition of skin vibrations has been characterized, its effect on their intensity has not. We found that the warping of the frequency composition of the vibrations could account for the bulk of the effect of scanning speed on intensity. We could further improve the fit by taking into account the resonance of the skin.
