To understand the effects of vaccination on such a fast-evolving pathogen, we simulated the dynamics of influenza in a vaccinated host population. Increasing vaccination rate decreases the average cumulative antigenic evolution of the viral population. However, the distribution of outcomes is clearly bimodal. Vaccination either drives the viral population extinct, or the population persists and evolves further than if vaccination had not taken place at all. Increasing vaccination rate decreases pathogen survival, but increases the antigenic evolution of surviving populations and the incidence among hosts. These results illustrate how vaccination against a pathogen whose evolution is driven by positive selection for rapidly emerging strains can antagonize or enhance antigenic evolution to the respective detriment or benefit of hosts.','',0,0,'','2017'),(22,'04212017155807_MindBytes-Guo.pdf','Ashley Guo','azguo@uchicago.edu','Graduate student','Institute for Molecular Engineering','Institute for Molecular Engineering','Midway, Software Packages','Juan de Pablo','Amyloidogenic Proteins: Identifying Early-stage Aggregation Mechanisms','Human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) is implicated in the onset of type II diabetes. hIAPP is known to aggregate into amyloid fibrils; however, it is prefibrillar species, not mature fibrils, that are proposed to be cytotoxic.

IDE also degrades amyloid-β, a peptide vital for Alzheimer\'s disease progression. IDE has two homologous, ~50 kDa N- and C-terminal domains, IDE-N and IDE-C. For IDE to effectively degrade its substrates, both domains must come together for the catalytic cleft to assume fully closed conformation. Experimental data suggests that IDE undergoes at least two conformational switches in its catalytic cycle: one, the transition between the closed- and open-conformations, and two, the “swinging door” motion at the catalytic cleft. However, the exact mechanism of these two conformational switches is unknown. We investigated this mechanism using microsecond-long molecular dynamics simulations of IDE structures with and without substrate. We find that the N-terminus of the insulin molecule chain-A forms a cross-β-sheet with IDE secondary structure elements, placing insulin near the catalytic site. Concordantly, insulin also undergoes conformational change; the insulin chain-B central α-helix becomes less ordered, a key step in the unfolding of insulin for degradation. The presence of insulin moves IDE-N and IDE-C closer (the angle between them decreases ~5°) and causes these two domains to undergo a grinding motion. Furthermore, greater flexibility for the door, H-loop, and the hinge and interface between IDE-N and IDE-C is evident when insulin is present. These observations suggest that the presence of insulin induces both global and local conformational changes in IDE to unfold insulin for cleavage. Principal component analysis shows negatively- correlated opening and closing motions of dimeric IDE, suggesting that the capture of substrate in one monomer may allosterically induce the other to open. Our simulation and principle component analysis offer new insight into substrate unfolding inside the IDE catalytic chamber and its allosteric regulation.','Scalability and Performance',1,0,'','2017'),(37,'04242017143402_Amyloid-Lipid-MindByts-2017.pdf','Esmael Jafari Haddadian','haddadian@uchicago.edu','Assistant Professor','Biological Sciences Division','Biology','Midway','Esmael Jafari Haddadian','Membrane Bilayers Help to Stabilize and Are Affected by Aβ-Peptides on the Surface','Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is an important and increasingly prevalent neurodegenerative disease. Aggregation of Aβ-peptides is important in etiology of AD and the interaction of these peptides with cell membranes is probably one of the key pathological events responsible for neuron cell death in AD. Using the supercomputer Anton, we modeled the interaction of unstructured Aβ-monomers and Aβ-peptides in the fibril structure (residues 1-40, PDB ID 2M4J, based on an AD brain-seeded fibril structure) with different lipid bilayers (POPC/Cholesterol, ratio 4:1; POPC/POPG/Cholesterol, 1:1:1; POPC/POPE/POPG 1:1:1). Our 20 -second long simulations starting with unstructured Aβ-monomers close to the lipid surface showed that the bilayer greatly accelerated the rate of structural conversion from a random coil to a β-structure as well as the aggregation of Aβ from monomers to interacting oligomers in comparison to our bulk simulations. This was the case regardless of the lipid composition. The six-layer brain-seeded fibril on the lipid surface partially unraveled, mainly, at its end facing away from the lipid; however, it maintained its overall shape and matched the structural stability of an infinitely long fibril model that we previously simulated. The brain-seeded fibril structure interacted strongly with lipid head-group atoms and constrained the motion of the lipid molecules under the structure; the diffusion of these molecules was reduced. These interactions also increased the ordering of lipid molecules underneath the fibril. Our simulations suggest that Aβ fibrils change the fluidity of the lipid bilayers and therefore may affect cellular function.','Scalability and Performance',1,0,'','2017'),(38,'04242017215206_posterSevgen042417.pdf','Selami Emre Sevgen','sesevgen@uchicago.edu','Graduate Student','Institute for Molecular Engineering','Institute for Molecular Engineering','Computational Scientists, Midway, Software Packages','Juan de Pablo','SSAGES (Software Suite for Advanced Generalized Ensemble Simulations) - Development and Applications','Molecular simulations are an essential tool in modern research, guiding experimental efforts and providing fundamental insights into underlying phenomena.

With ~60 var genes per genome, it is unclear whether immune selection can act as a dominant force in structuring var repertoires of local populations. We use the combination of network analyses of genetic similarity with agent-based models that track immune memory in each host, to identify signatures of dominant processes underlying strain structure. We test our theoretical predictions using empirical molecular data from Ghana, unique in their depth of population sampling, and find unequivocal evidence for an important role of immune selection at both static and temporal levels. Therefore, monitoring var gene diversity and structure becomes central to understanding malaria epidemiology.',NULL,1,0,NULL,'2018'),(62,'04112018173511_poster[BEIRIGER][041118].pdf','Anastasia Beiriger','beiriger@uchicago.edu','graduate student','Biological Sciences Division','Organismal Biology and Anatomy','Computational Scientists, Midway, Visualization','Victoria Prince','Reconstructing neuronal lineages using whole-brain cell tracking on Midway','To establish connectivity in the brain, neurons migrate from their birthplaces to final locations where they integrate into the neural circuitry. We study the facial branchiomotor neurons (FBMNs), which control facial expression and jaw movement in vertebrates. In zebrafish, the first FBMN to migrate acts as a pioneer – when it is absent, FBMN migration ceases. Using single-plane illumination microscopy (SPIM), we are investigating the origins of FBMNs to understand how differences between pioneer and follower FBMNs arise. SPIM generates vast amounts of data, which must be analyzed and visualized in a reproducible manner. We have adapted an automated pipeline (Amat et. al., 2015) with scripts for data compression, drift correction, cell segmentation and lineage reconstruction for use on Midway. We have also generated pre- and post- processing scripts in Fiji and Matlab to prep data sets for analysis and edit FBMN lineages and migratory trajectories for accuracy after cell tracking.',NULL,1,0,NULL,'2018'),(63,'04122018104223_blank_poster.pdf','Courtney Orsbon','orsbon@uchicago.edu','Graduate Student','Biological Sciences Division','Organismal Biology & Anatomy','Computational Scientists, Midway, Software Packages, Visualization','Callum Ross','Hyolingual Biomechanics of Macaca mulatta','This research investigates the biomechanics of the tongue and hyoid apparatus during swallowing in a nonhuman primate model system.

Our goal was to build a mobile app to use walking as a way to maximize exposure to natural elements, to counter some disadvantages of urban living (e.g. noise and stress) while completing daily errands. Starting with a network of Hyde Park, we created input maps in ArcGIS which quantified greenspace (LiDAR data), local sound (SoundScore data), and crime (all “visible” crimes in one year period, City of Chicago data portal) for each edge in the network. Each edge was assigned a Restoration Score (RS) by weighting the input values. Routes were generated for the network using an impedance model with Length/RS as the cost attribute.

One efficient means to construct a high-level overview of research trends is to conduct a text mining analysis on academic publications. We applied text-mining techniques to build a psychological science (PS) semantic network based on one million abstracts from PubMed. We identified 111,571 PS abstracts based on three tokens: ‘psycholog’, ‘behavior’, and ‘neurosci.’ We then built a dictionary of 847 PS tokens by removing the 1,000 top-frequent non-PS tokens from the 2,000 top-frequent PS tokens and by visual inspection. Our network was built on an adjacency matrix that counted the number of abstracts in which each pair of tokens in the dictionary co-occurred. Through modularity analysis, we identified six large modules.

These SiNWs exhibited directional BM, which is not predicted by existent BM theories, although they are limited in scope to smaller AR particles.\r\nA simple method for tracking axial rotation of an anisotropic particle has been established by tracking the motion of a small kink on the SiNW\'s terminus with an optical microscope. By measuring the change in observed kink length, the wire\'s longitudinal rotation can be calculated. The NW can be used as a freestanding tracker for probing dynamic fluid processes.

The island population of Sardinia in particular has been hypothesized to have a relatively stable and continuous population from the early Neolithic, largely on the basis of modern Sardinian DNA. Here we directly assess continuity using genome-wide capture data (~1.2 millions SNPs) of 26 ancient humans from the island of Sardinia spanning the Neolithic, Copper Age, and Bronze Age, including individuals from the Nuragic culture.
